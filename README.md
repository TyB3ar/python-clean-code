This is my submission for Module 4 Lesson 4 assignment. 
There are 2 modules present, the 'orginial_weather_forecaster' being the original script given with messy code that needed refactoring. 
The other module named 'refactored_weather_forecaster' is the refactored form of the original script, with more organized classes with specific functions. 
The methods for 'fetch_weather_data' and 'parse_weather_data' were each put into their own seperate classes, for organization purposes. 
The methods for 'get_detailed_forecast' and 'display_weather' were both placed into the 'UserInterface' class. 
The 'main' method is still called seperately on its own, with calls to each class based on user response. 
Thank you!
